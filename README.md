 ### CircleSort ###
 
Allows you to generate lines around a circle; you can set max R,G,B, and A values for lines which are generated with random values 0 - max.
You can then perform a BubbleSort using any one of these 4 values and watch the sorting algorithm take place whilst also adjusting speed.
After adjusting the RGB lines, redraw the lines with the new values.
