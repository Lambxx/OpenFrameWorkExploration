# OpenFrameWorkExploration
 Exploration Of OpenFramworks.
 This project is in order to gain familiarisation with OpenFrameworks in c++.
 The goal is to gain the technical skills for my next project: Zeta. Which will be a visual exploration of the Riemann Zeta Function.

 ## Projects ##

 ### CircleSort ###
 
Allows you to generate lines around a circle; you can set max R,G,B, and A values for lines which are generated with random values 0 - max.
You can then perform a BubbleSort using any one of these 4 values, and watch the sorting algorithm take place whilst also adjusting speed.
To see the project in action, you can download the folder CircleSort2 from the repo.
A GitHub Page for this project where you can use it on the web, will be coming soon.


### Zeta ###
Zeta (TBC...)
Zeta is an exploration of Riemmans Zeta's function; I would first like to acknowledge the book Music of the Primes by Marcus du Sautoy for inspiring me to explore this topic.
