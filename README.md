# OpenFrameWorkExploration
 Exploration Of OpenFramworks.
 This project is in order to gain familiarisation with OpenFrameworks in c++.
The goal is to gain the technical skills for my next project: Zeta. Which will be a visual exploration of the Riemann Zeta Function.

 ### CircleSort ###
 
Allows you to generate lines around a circle; you can set max R,G,B, and A values for lines which are generated with random values 0 - max.
You can then perform a BubbleSort using any one of these 4 values and watch the sorting algorithm take place whilst also adjusting speed.
After adjusting the RGB lines, make sure to redraw the lines with the new values.
A GitHub Page for this project, where you can use it on the web, is available [here](https://lambxx.github.io/OpenFrameWorkExploration/)
